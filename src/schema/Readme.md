## Metadata schema

This folder presents the Metadata schema that was developed as part of the Plaground. This schema is an extension of the so-called DAMS schema, originally proposed by Welten et al.[^1]. The schema uses the [Web Ontology Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/) as its ontology language and is serialized using [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/). 

In the file ```schema.owl```, we show our addition to DAMS and relevant parts of the original schema. The latest version of the whole schema is available at the [PHT Metadata Schema Specification Website](https://schema.padme-analytics.de).


Examples that adhere to the presented schema are provided in this repository as part of the _evaluation_ folder. Moreover, we provide an additional example in the _backend_ folder, as described in the corresponding readme file.
