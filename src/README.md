# PADME Playground

Welcome to the codebase of the PADME Playground. The playground consists of **two** main components: A **backend** written in Node.js and a **frontend** written with Typescript using Angular and Material. Both the backend and frontend are provided via [Visual Studio Code (VSC) development containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) to allow an easy setup.

Setting up the playground on your machine requires a local [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installation. If you do not have Docker installed, you can find instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Moreover, we require you to install the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension in VSC in order to start the dev containers.

Please follow the instructions in the 'backend' sub-folder first to start an backend instance. Afterward, you can start the frontend by following the instructions provided in the 'frontend' folder.

## Disclaimer

The configuration files provided in this repository are **only meant for local development**. Please **do not setup a production instance without adjusting the configurations first**. For example, you will need to replace default user names and passwords with appropriate values!
