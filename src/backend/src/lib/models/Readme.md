## Models

I want to say a few words about the models. 
Currently, we are supporting two types of datasets: object-oriented and relational (read the thesis for more info). 
However, the wording for these two types is different. E.g. a relational database has tables with columns and a object collection consists of objects with attributes. 

I did not come up with a proper wording that covers both cases nicely. Therefore, I decided to simply go with the wording for relations since these have been supported first. 

Consequently, a dataset can be of type "object" and support recursion (as described in the Thesis) but still have tables and columns. 

I hope this does not confuse too much. 

P.S. If you come up with a good wording that covers both cases feel happy to change it :D
